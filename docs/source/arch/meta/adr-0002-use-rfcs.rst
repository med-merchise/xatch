Status
------

Accepted

Context
-------

A process of analysis is necessary to make any `decision <adr-0001>`:ref:.  We
need to record the relevant architectural discussions made on this project.

Decision
--------

We will use |RFCs|, as `described by Bruno Scheufler <scheufler_>`__.

Consequences
------------

RFC documents contain technical specifications and organizational notes for
the project that do not constitute `concrete decisions <adr-0001>`:ref:.
Writing and sharing these analyzes with others creates responsibility and
accountability.
