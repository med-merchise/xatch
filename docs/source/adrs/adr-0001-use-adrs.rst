===============================================

Decision

We will use ADRs as described by the `xint <xint-adr-1_>`__ project.

Consequences
------------

This project will produce its own architectural documents, but also will
"inherit" ADRs from upper level projects.

Foundation and Common Systems:

  - `xint <xint-adrs_>`__
